# Visioclinic Task
## Pose Detection Task

This is a script that takes a video as input and outputs a video with pose & hand landmarks drawn to it using Google's Mediapipe library  <br>
**NOTES:** 
- Providing own OAuth credentials json file is needed. Once ready, change the creds_path variable in Paths cell.
- token.js is provided, use it to directly access the video in the drive. (It's a throway account)
